Diary about the progress of this project.

Really needs to reconsider how MeshData, Textures and Models are stored.
We are considering turning them into a kind of Database that only exposes its ID.
Turning Meshes and Textures into a kind of database will have the added benefit of very few copying of large vertices vector.

Additionally, rendering process also needs to be reconsidered.
Now, instead of rendering each model, we should actually render each mesh.

Furthermore, any kind of GL stuff that cannot be multithreaded away can easily be deferred as jobs into the database.
